For our UFO challenge, we had to build a dynamic table using JavaScript and incorporate it into a web site using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap, and that's what we did!
Using JavaScript and HTML, we modifyied the code in index.html file to create more table filters. In addition to the date filter we created in this module, we have added filters for the city, state, country, and shape, as shown in final webpage.
In Summary, the webpage was created as ordered with all needed filters, buttons, order, color, and data.
