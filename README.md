For our UFO challenge, we had to build a dynamic table using JavaScript and incorporate it into a web site using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap, and that's what we did!
* Using JavaScript and HTML, we modifyied the code in index.html file to create more table filters. 
* In addition to the date filter we created in this module, we have added filters for the city, state, country, and shape, as shown in final webpage.
* In Conclusion, the webpage was created as ordered with all needed filters, buttons, order, color, and data.
